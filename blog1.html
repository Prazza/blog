		<h1>Initial Thoughts</h1>
			<p> 
				The weeks leading up to beginning the MakerSquare front-end course, I decided to set some initial goals for myself. In thinking about what I wanted my goals to be, I had to step back and look at the big picture. And the big picture <span>being my life</span>. 
			</p>
		<h2> Initial Goals </h2>
			<p> 
				Coming into the course, I deicded I needed to set a working goal for myself, and that it was something that would be relavent to my life. So.... I figured I'd make a <span>food blog!</p> I mean, I am eating everyday, three or more times a day, so I'd have plenty of material to source from.
