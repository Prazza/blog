		<h1>Initial Thoughts</h1>
			<p> 
				Initially, my thoughts and interests for seeking out the MakerSquare experience was that I was looking to learn coding. Whether it would lead to a career change or if I would find application of these new skills in my current career, I don't know. 
			</p>
		<h2> Initial Goals </h2>
			<p> 
				I decided that to get the most out of this class that I needed to set some goals for myself that I would be able to apply once I finished the program. After a good bit of contemplation I reasoned out that I should do a food blog. Not only would it be a good way to keep all my skills reinforced, but eating and taking photos of what I eat is something that I do everyday. So all the possible material that I'd need for the blog I already have.
