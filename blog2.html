		<h1>Week 1 - Recap</h1>
			<p> 
			As to be expected, the first week is usually the easiest. On the first day, everyone made sure that their computers were up to speed and that everyone was on the same page after coming off all the pre-work materials that were required of us. It was fun getting to hear everyone's introductions that easily broke the ice between everyone. It was also good to know that we each got assinged a partner that we're able to work with in and outside of class. Being an intensive class, packed full of tons of fast moving information, I assume my partner will be an invaluable tool in not only helping me understand the materials, but also reinforce them if my partner has any questions, and vice versa. 

			On the first Wednsday we hit the ground running. Covering many of the basics that we're going to need to know for the class. Your basic HTML overview and githubbing all of our projects to the web. 

			All the instructors seem highly informed on the class material and are good at explaining things from diffent angles to better the understanding.

			I also enjoyed the drinks that followed the Wednesday night class. Not necessarily for the beer, but because it gave us the opporunity to further break the social barriers between the students and the instructors. I firmly believe to make the most out of this class, I'll have to be completely engaged with the instructors and some of the like minded students as well.

		<h2> My thoughts </h2>
			<p> 
			 I really wasn't sure what to expect before going to the first class.I was suprised to see that there was a good amount of people in the class, and that many of them were from various backgrounds looking to do the same thing as me. Either picking up a new set of skills to apply to their current situation or start the process of developing themselves into a new career field.
